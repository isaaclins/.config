# Configuration

Configuration controls browser access, strict accessibility execution, and optional action confirmations.

## Files

Global config:

```text
~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-computer-use.json
```

Project config:

```text
.pi/computer-use.json
```

Project config overrides global config. Environment variables override both.

Example:

```json
{
  "browser_use": true,
  "stealth_mode": false,
  "confirmation_mode": "off"
}
```

Run `/computer-use` in Pi to show the active config and its source.

## Options

### `browser_use`

Default: `true`

When `false`, the extension refuses known browser windows. This is useful for projects that should not control browsers.

Known browser families include Safari, Chrome and Chromium-family browsers, Firefox, Arc, Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, and Helium.

### `stealth_mode`

Default: `false`

When `true`, actions must use background-safe platform accessibility paths. Raw pointer events, raw keyboard events, foreground focus fallback, and cursor takeover are blocked.

This is also called strict AX mode in the legacy environment variable names.

### `confirmation_mode`

Default: `"off"`

- `"off"` permits state-changing tools without confirmation in interactive and noninteractive modes.
- `"first-use"` asks once for each exact app root or browser target in the current Pi session.
- `"always"` asks before every state-changing tool action.

The confirmation system is target-scoped only. It does not inspect or classify UI content, typed text, URLs, or JavaScript. Modes that require confirmation fail closed when Pi has no interactive UI.

## Environment variables

```bash
PI_COMPUTER_USE_BROWSER_USE=0
PI_COMPUTER_USE_BROWSER_USE=1
PI_COMPUTER_USE_STEALTH_MODE=0
PI_COMPUTER_USE_STEALTH_MODE=1
PI_COMPUTER_USE_CONFIRMATION_MODE=off
PI_COMPUTER_USE_CONFIRMATION_MODE=first-use
PI_COMPUTER_USE_CONFIRMATION_MODE=always
PI_COMPUTER_USE_STEALTH=1
PI_COMPUTER_USE_STRICT_AX=1
PI_COMPUTER_USE_HELPER_VARIANT=auto
PI_COMPUTER_USE_HELPER_VARIANT=modern
PI_COMPUTER_USE_HELPER_VARIANT=legacy
PI_COMPUTER_USE_CDP_PORT=9222
```

`PI_COMPUTER_USE_STEALTH=1` and `PI_COMPUTER_USE_STRICT_AX=1` force strict AX mode.

`PI_COMPUTER_USE_HELPER_VARIANT` is macOS-only and defaults to `auto`. macOS 14 and newer use the modern ScreenCaptureKit helper. macOS 12 and 13 use the legacy CGWindow and `screencapture` helper. Override this only for testing.

## CDP browser support

`PI_COMPUTER_USE_CDP_PORT` enables Chrome DevTools Protocol support for Chromium-family browsers. Launch the browser with `--remote-debugging-port=<port>` and set this variable to the same port.

When CDP is active:

- `navigate_browser` uses CDP navigation when possible.
- Browser console messages are attached to relevant tool results.
- The desktop observe/act tools still work for browser windows.

With the variable unset, CDP is inactive.
