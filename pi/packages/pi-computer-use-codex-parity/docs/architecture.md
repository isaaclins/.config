# Architecture

`pi-computer-use` gives Pi agents a small, inspectable interface for desktop GUI control on macOS and Windows.

The core loop is:

```text
find roots → observe root → search/expand/inspect → act → refresh state
```

A root is a top-level controllable UI surface. The platform seam guarantees only the split between ordinary windows and transients; specific root kinds such as sheet, dialog, popover, or menu are best-effort presentation hints and never drive shared behavior. Public root refs use `@rN`; element refs inside the current observation still use `@eN`.

## Layers

| Layer | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Pi extension | Registers the public tools and schemas. |
| TypeScript bridge | Manages state, refs, browser/CDP support, notes, outline folding, optional confirmations, and tool results. |
| Platform backend | Exposes a generic root/observe/act contract to shared orchestration. |
| Native platform backend/helper | Performs accessibility inspection, root enumeration, window capture, input dispatch, permission probes when the OS requires them, and helper-side action verification. |
| Platform permissions | macOS enforces Accessibility and Screen Recording. Windows support uses the active desktop session and Windows accessibility/input APIs. |

## Observation

`observe_ui` asks the backend for one atomic look at a root. A look includes:

- platform-neutral root identity and facts
- platform accessibility API-derived UI structure (AX on macOS, UIA on Windows)
- optional image evidence for image-bearing roots
- text boxes when OCR/vision is needed
- timing and capture metadata

The bridge converts that look into a folded outline. Every visible outline node gets a stable tool ref such as `@e12` for the current state. Large subtrees are summarized until the agent calls `expand_ui` or `search_ui`.

Transient roots may be semantic-only when the OS does not expose a capturable window image. Coordinate actions clearly reject those looks; use semantic `@e` refs instead.

Modality is a platform-reported fact. Backends fold platform-specific modal/dialog/sheet signals into `isModal`; shared scoring and displacement consume only that fact.

## Acting

`act_ui` performs one action transaction. The backend/helper owns the actual input decision:

1. resolve the exact target and request any configured confirmation
2. validate the current state and target ref or coordinate
3. ground it to a platform accessibility element or coordinates
4. preflight permissions and target state
5. execute the action
6. verify what happened when possible
7. return `worked`, `didnt`, or `unknown` with evidence and any shallow `rootDelta`

Refs from `observe_ui`, `search_ui`, and `expand_ui` are preferred. Coordinate actions are available as fallback, but they are tied to the latest observed image-bearing root. If a root appears in a delta, agent guidance is uniform across platforms: observe it.

`deltaSource` is a free-form diagnostic string naming the backend's delta mechanism. It is not part of the behavioral contract; shared code only treats its presence as evidence that the backend already awaited UI quiescence.

## Optional confirmations

Read-only inspection does not prompt. State-changing actions pass through a generic confirmation gate before the helper receives input. `confirmation_mode` controls the gate:

- `off`, the default, never prompts.
- `first-use` prompts once per exact app root or browser target in the current Pi session.
- `always` prompts for every state-changing action.

The gate does not inspect content or apply target, password, CAPTCHA, terminal, account, or risk categories. Confirmation copy identifies only the target and generic action, never typed text or JavaScript payloads. Approvals are memory-only and reset on `session_start`. A mode that requires confirmation fails closed without an interactive UI; `off` works without one.

## Running note

The bridge maintains a short disposable note per root. It summarizes the latest useful UI state and recent action outcomes so the next tool result has continuity without replaying the whole outline.

The note is derived state. If it is wrong or stale, another look replaces it.

## Browser support

Browser roots can be controlled through the same desktop tools. When CDP is enabled, browser-specific tools can also navigate, evaluate JavaScript, and inspect browser contexts directly.

## Design constraints

- Prefer platform semantics over image-only guessing.
- Keep the default observation compact.
- Expand locally instead of dumping entire trees.
- Let the backend/helper own action execution and verification.
- Keep the seam platform-neutral: platform mechanisms belong in backend internals or free-form diagnostics, not shared contract types.
- Keep stale refs and coordinates scoped to the state that produced them.
- Avoid compatibility shims for removed public tools.
